## Abstract
This project focuses on Predictive Maintenance in engineering using machine learning. Predictive Maintenance uses data-driven methods to analyze equipment conditions and predict maintenance needs. We worked with a synthetic dataset of 10,000 records and 14 features from the UCI ML repository, applying data preprocessing, feature engineering, and implementing machine learning models. The goal was to optimize maintenance timing, improve productivity, and reduce costs.

## Introduction
Predictive Maintenance aims to predict equipment failures using data insights. We discuss its evolution from early challenges to recent advancements in IoT, cloud computing, and data analytics. Our project covers data collection, preprocessing, and model implementation using Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We used various visualizations like histograms, pair plots, line plots, heatmaps, and violin plots to understand data distribution, correlations, and patterns in the dataset. This helped us make informed decisions during preprocessing.

## Feature Engineering
We applied feature engineering techniques like data splitting and PCA to improve model performance. We also addressed multicollinearity using PCA and achieved dimensionality reduction.

## Model Implementations
We implemented Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines to predict equipment failure. Each model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results and Conclusion
Our project demonstrated that Logistic Regression outperformed other models with an F1-score of 0.99. This indicates its effectiveness in predicting equipment failures. Predictive Maintenance can revolutionize industries by enhancing safety, productivity, and cost efficiency.
